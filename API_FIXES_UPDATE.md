# API Fixes Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Assessment History Endpoint (500 Error)

The assessment history endpoint was returning 500 errors with "'list' object has no attribute 'get'". This was happening because the endpoint was directly returning SQLAlchemy ORM objects, which were being converted to a list when being serialized.

**Fix implemented:**
- Modified the API endpoint to explicitly convert SQLAlchemy ORM objects to dictionaries that match the Pydantic schema structure
- Updated all assessment history endpoints (GET /history, GET /{id}, POST /)
- This ensures proper serialization of response data

### 2. Fixed OpenAI API Version Compatibility Issues

The OpenAI integration was failing with the error: "You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0".

**Fix implemented:**
- Created a helper module (`backend/utils/openai_helper.py`) that handles API version differences
- Updated the API router prefix from "/ai" to "/openai" to match frontend expectations
- Applied fixes to patient chat functionality that was using the old API format
- Created a patching system to ensure compatibility across the application

### 3. Additional Improvements

- Added better error handling for API calls
- Fixed import issues to prevent circular dependencies
- Improved logging for better troubleshooting
- Made the system robust against different OpenAI library versions

## Testing

To verify these fixes:

1. **Assessment History Endpoint:**
   - Access `/assessments/history` endpoint - it should now return proper JSON data
   - Create and retrieve assessments through the API

2. **OpenAI Integration:**
   - Use the chat functionality - it should now work with either OpenAI API version
   - The patient chat endpoint should no longer return 500 errors

## Technical Details

### OpenAI Helper

The OpenAI helper module (`backend/utils/openai_helper.py`) detects the installed OpenAI library version and uses the appropriate API format:

- For OpenAI Python SDK >= 1.0.0: Uses the new client-based approach with `openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create()`
- For OpenAI Python SDK < 1.0.0: Uses the old module-level approach with `openai.ChatCompletion.create()`

### Assessment History Response Format

The assessment history endpoints now manually construct the response objects with the exact structure expected by the Pydantic schemas, ensuring compatibility between the ORM layer and the API response serialization.

## Next Steps

- Monitor the application for any remaining API issues
- Consider updating all OpenAI integrations to use the latest API format
- Add comprehensive unit tests for API endpoints to catch serialization issues early

## Additional Fixes Needed

### 1. JWT Authentication in Assessment History Endpoints

During verification, we identified an issue with JWT authentication in the assessment history endpoints:

- The endpoints return 401 Unauthorized errors even when valid tokens are provided
- Multiple attempts to authenticate via the `/auth/login` endpoint result in 500 errors
- Manually generated JWT tokens work for the `/health` endpoint but not for assessment history

**Recommended fixes:**
- Ensure consistent JWT secret key usage across the application
- Add better error handling and logging in the token validation process
- Fix authentication middleware to properly handle assessment history endpoints
- Create a direct database authentication method as a fallback for testing

### 2. Connection Handling Issues

The API endpoints experience connection-related issues:

- "Connection broken: IncompleteRead" errors when accessing assessment history endpoints
- Premature connection termination during large responses

**Recommended fixes:**
- Check for and fix middleware that might be affecting response handling
- Ensure proper Content-Length headers are set in responses
- Add timeout and retry logic to handle unstable connections
- Fix any response serialization that might be causing corrupted output
