# Stroke Rehabilitation AI Platform - Fixes Documentation

## Overview

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to address issues with the Stroke Rehabilitation AI Platform.

## 1. Assessment History Endpoints Fix

### Issue
The assessment history endpoints were returning 500 errors with the error message "'list' object has no attribute 'get'".

### Root Cause
The assessment data was stored as a list in some cases, but the code was trying to access it as a dictionary.

### Fix Implementation
- Added proper handling for list data in assessment results by converting lists to dictionaries with an "items" key
- Fixed JSON serialization issues with datetime objects in the assessment history endpoints
- Modified middleware to skip processing for assessment history endpoints

### Verification
- Used the `verify-assessment-history.ps1` script to confirm the fix works
- Ensured no more 500 errors are returned from assessment history endpoints

## 2. Excessive Profile Requests Fix

### Issue
The profile endpoints were experiencing excessive requests, causing many 429 Too Many Requests responses.

### Root Cause
The rate limiting was too aggressive and not properly managed.

### Fix Implementation
- Modified the rate limiting in ContentLengthMiddleware to use a more reasonable 5-second window
- Added cleanup mechanism for old rate-limiting entries to prevent memory leaks
- Updated error messages to be more informative about the wait time

### Verification
- Created a test script to verify the rate limiting behaves as expected
- Confirmed requests are properly throttled but allowed after the waiting period

## 3. Email Configuration Fix

### Issue
Users were not receiving verification emails during registration.

### Root Cause
Email configuration settings were not properly loaded from environment variables or had no fallback mechanism.

### Fix Implementation
- Added fallback for loading email configuration from `.env` file when not set in environment variables
- Fixed email utils to properly handle missing configuration
- Added informative error logging for email configuration issues

### Verification
- Created a verification script to test email configuration
- Verified emails can be sent when properly configured

## 4. OpenAI API Integration Fix

### Issue
Missing OpenAI API keys were causing errors without proper fallback.

### Root Cause
The OpenAI integration didn't have proper error handling for missing API keys.

### Fix Implementation
- Enhanced error handling for missing OpenAI API keys
- Implemented development fallback for OpenAI API calls
- Added user-friendly error messages for API authentication issues
- Updated the OpenAI client code to work with both legacy (<1.0.0) and new (>=1.0.0) versions of the API

### Verification
- Created a verification script to test OpenAI integration
- Confirmed both real API keys and development fallbacks work as expected

## Modified Files

1. `backend/api/assessment_history.py` - Fixed JSON serialization and list handling
2. `backend/main.py` - Updated rate limiting and middleware processing
3. `backend/utils/openai_helper.py` - Enhanced OpenAI integration with proper error handling
4. `backend/utils/email_utils.py` - Improved email configuration with fallbacks

## New Verification Scripts

1. `verify-email-configuration.ps1` - Tests email configuration
2. `verify-openai-integration.ps1` - Tests OpenAI API integration
3. `verify-all-fixes.ps1` - Comprehensive verification of all fixes

## Conclusion

All identified issues have been fixed and verified. The Stroke Rehabilitation AI Platform should now be more stable and user-friendly, with better error handling and performance.
