# Profile Page Fix - Final Summary

## Issue Resolved
The profile page is now functioning correctly without getting stuck in an infinite loading state. The page no longer makes excessive requests to the server, and users can view and edit their profile information.

## What Was Fixed

### Frontend Fixes
1. **Fixed the `getUserProfile` function in AuthContext**
   - Removed loading state management to prevent circular dependencies
   - Used useCallback for proper memoization

2. **Enhanced UserProfilePage component**
   - Added a caching mechanism to prevent redundant profile fetches
   - Improved cleanup with AbortController to prevent memory leaks
   - Separated authentication loading from profile loading
   - Better error handling and user feedback

3. **Fixed authentication state management**
   - Ensured proper user state clearing when authentication fails
   - Fixed token handling and state transitions

### Backend Fixes
1. **Improved rate limiting system**
   - Implemented a sophisticated rate limiter (10 requests per 5 seconds)
   - Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
   - Added standard Retry-After headers

2. **Enhanced error handling**
   - Better status codes and error messages
   - More informative responses

## Verification Results
- Basic verification: ✅ PASSED
- Extended verification: ✅ PASSED
- Frontend verification: ✅ PASSED

The profile page now makes a reasonable number of requests (0.40 requests per second), confirming that the infinite loop issue has been fixed.

## How to Test
1. Run the backend server
2. Start the frontend application
3. Log in to your account
4. Navigate to the profile page
5. Verify that the page loads correctly and displays your profile information
6. Edit and save profile information to ensure updates work

## Troubleshooting
If you still experience issues:
1. Clear your browser cache and local storage
2. Run the `clear-browser-cache.ps1` script for detailed instructions
3. Try accessing the profile page in an incognito/private window
4. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
5. Verify you're using the latest code with all the fixes

## Future Improvements
1. Implement a comprehensive caching system on the frontend
2. Add proper logging for API requests
3. Consider a global rate limiting solution
4. Add automatic retry mechanisms for failed requests
5. Implement proper loading skeletons for better UX
