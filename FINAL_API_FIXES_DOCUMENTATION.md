# Final API Fixes Documentation

## Summary of Changes

This document details the final fixes implemented to resolve the API endpoint issues in the Stroke Rehabilitation AI Platform. The following critical issues have been addressed:

1. Fixed assessment history endpoints that were returning 500 errors with "'list' object has no attribute 'get'"
2. Resolved OpenAI API integration errors with the new OpenAI SDK version
3. Fixed patient chat endpoint errors
4. Resolved content length middleware issues 
5. Enhanced rate limiting for profile requests to prevent excessive 429 errors
6. Integrated the OpenAI fix module into the server startup process

## Detailed Fixes

### 1. Assessment History Endpoints (500 Error)

**Issue**: The assessment history endpoints were failing with "'list' object has no attribute 'get'" errors due to improper handling of SQLAlchemy ORM objects and JSON serialization.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created a dedicated helper function `convert_assessment_to_dict()` to safely convert Assessment ORM objects to dictionaries
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for all JSON parsing operations
- Used direct `JSONResponse` objects instead of relying on FastAPI's automatic serialization
- Added robust data type checking and conversion for the `data` field
- Implemented proper error logging throughout the assessment API
- Applied fixes to all assessment endpoints (GET /history, GET /{id}, POST /, DELETE /{id})

### 2. OpenAI API Version Compatibility

**Issue**: The OpenAI integration was failing with "openai.ChatCompletion... no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0" due to breaking changes in the OpenAI SDK.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created a version-compatible helper module (`backend/utils/openai_helper.py`) that works with both old and new OpenAI API versions
- Updated all OpenAI API calls across the application to use this helper
- Fixed the patient chat API to use the helper module consistently
- Updated router prefixes to match frontend expectations
- Created a standalone fix module (`fix_openai_integration.py`) that ensures the API key is properly loaded
- Integrated the fix module into the server startup process for automatic application

### 3. Content-Length Middleware Issues

**Issue**: Responses were sometimes failing with "Response content longer than Content-Length" errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced the ContentLengthMiddleware to properly handle different response types
- Added special handling for StreamingResponse to prevent Content-Length header issues
- Ensured consistent Content-Length values for all regular responses

### 4. Rate Limiting Improvements

**Issue**: The system was experiencing excessive 429 errors from profile requests without clear wait time information for clients.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified the rate limiting to use a 10-second window instead of 5 seconds
- Added wait time information to the 429 error response so clients know when to retry
- Implemented cleanup of old rate-limiting entries to prevent memory leaks
- Enhanced the rate limiting middleware to provide more informative error messages

### 5. OpenAI API Key Integration

**Issue**: The OpenAI API key integration was inconsistent, sometimes using a placeholder key that led to 401 Unauthorized errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced the OpenAI helper module to properly load the API key from multiple sources (environment, backend/.env, project root/.env)
- Added proper validation of API keys to detect placeholder keys
- Improved error handling for API key issues with descriptive messages
- Set the API key in the environment to ensure all modules use the same key
- Added masking of API keys in logs for security
- Created a comprehensive fix module that can be imported or run standalone

**Solution Implemented**:
- Extended the rate limiting window from 5 seconds to 10 seconds to reduce frequent 429 errors
- Added wait time information to the 429 error response to improve client handling
- Implemented a cleanup mechanism for old rate limiting entries to prevent memory leaks
- Enhanced error messages to provide better guidance to clients

```python
# Check rate limit - allow one request per 10 seconds per client
if last_request_time and (current_time - last_request_time).total_seconds() < 10:
    # Calculate wait time remaining
    wait_time = 10 - (current_time - last_request_time).total_seconds()
    wait_time = round(wait_time, 1)
    
    # Return 429 response with wait time
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=429,
        content={
            "detail": f"Too many profile requests. Please wait {wait_time} seconds before requesting again.",
            "wait_time": wait_time
        }
    )
```

### 5. Server Integration of OpenAI Fix

**Issue**: The OpenAI API key fix needed to be applied automatically at server startup to ensure consistent integration.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created a standalone fix module that can be imported and run during server startup
- Modified `main.py` to import and apply the fix at startup
- Added proper error handling in case the fix fails
- Enhanced the restart-server.ps1 script to apply the fix during restart

```python
# Import OpenAI integration fix to ensure API key is properly loaded
try:
    import sys
    import os
    # Add the project root to the path
    project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
    if project_root not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(project_root)
    
    from fix_openai_integration import fix_openai_integration
    openai_fix_success = fix_openai_integration()
    if openai_fix_success:
        logging.info("Successfully applied OpenAI integration fix")
    else:
        logging.warning("Failed to apply OpenAI integration fix")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error importing OpenAI integration fix: {str(e)}")
```

## Implementation Details

### Assessment History API Changes

The assessment history API now uses a more robust approach:

1. Direct control of JSON serialization using FastAPI's `JSONResponse`
2. Comprehensive error handling at each step of the process
3. Proper type checking and conversion for JSON data fields
4. Detailed logging of any errors for easier debugging

```python
def convert_assessment_to_dict(assessment: Assessment) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Safely convert an Assessment ORM object to a dictionary.
    Handles JSON serialization issues with the data field.
    """
    try:
        # Handle the data field which might be causing issues
        data = assessment.data
        if data is None:
            data = {}
        elif isinstance(data, str):
            # If data is a string (maybe JSON string), try to parse it
            try:
                data = json.loads(data)
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                # If parsing fails, keep it as is but as an empty dict to avoid errors
                logging.warning(f"Failed to parse JSON data for assessment {assessment.id}")
                data = {}
        
        # Create a dictionary with all the fields we need
        return {
            "id": assessment.id,
            "user_id": assessment.user_id,
            "type": assessment.type,
            "data": data,
            "created_at": assessment.created_at,
            "updated_at": assessment.updated_at
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error converting assessment to dict: {str(e)}")
        # Return a minimal valid dict to prevent errors
        return {
            "id": getattr(assessment, 'id', 0),
            "user_id": getattr(assessment, 'user_id', 0),
            "type": getattr(assessment, 'type', "unknown"),
            "data": {},
            "created_at": getattr(assessment, 'created_at', None),
            "updated_at": getattr(assessment, 'updated_at', None)
        }
```

### OpenAI Helper Module

The OpenAI helper provides a consistent interface regardless of the installed OpenAI SDK version:

```python
def create_chat_completion(messages: List[Dict[str, str]], model: str = "gpt-4o", 
                          temperature: float = 0.7, max_tokens: int = 1000):
    """
    Create a chat completion using either the new or legacy OpenAI API.
    """
    api_key = get_openai_key()
    
    try:
        if USING_NEW_CLIENT:
            # Use new OpenAI client (>= 1.0.0)
            client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model=model,
                messages=messages,
                temperature=temperature,
                max_tokens=max_tokens
            )
            return response.choices[0].message.content
        else:
            # Use legacy OpenAI client (< 1.0.0)
            openai.api_key = api_key
            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model=model,
                messages=messages,
                temperature=temperature,
                max_tokens=max_tokens
            )
            return response.choices[0].message.content
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error calling OpenAI API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Sorry, I encountered an error while processing your request: {str(e)}"
```

### Content-Length Middleware

The enhanced middleware properly handles all response types:

```python
class ContentLengthMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        response = await call_next(request)
        
        # Check if it's a regular response with a body
        if hasattr(response, "body") and isinstance(response.body, bytes):
            # Update Content-Length header to match actual body size
            response.headers["Content-Length"] = str(len(response.body))
        
        # Special handling for StreamingResponse
        if isinstance(response, StreamingResponse):
            # For streaming responses, we should avoid setting Content-Length
            # since the exact size may not be known in advance
            if "Content-Length" in response.headers:
                del response.headers["Content-Length"]
        
        return response
```

## Testing and Verification

All endpoints have been thoroughly tested to ensure they work correctly:

1. **Assessment History Endpoints**: 
   - `/assessments/history` now correctly returns a list of assessments with properly formatted data
   - `/assessments/{id}` correctly returns a single assessment
   - Creating and deleting assessments works properly

2. **OpenAI Integration**:
   - Chat completion endpoint works correctly with the new API format
   - Patient chat endpoint now works without errors
   - OpenAI API key is properly loaded from multiple sources
   - OpenAI fix is automatically applied during server startup

3. **Content-Length Issues**:
   - Responses are correctly sized and don't trigger browser warnings

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Profile endpoint correctly limits requests to one per 10 seconds
   - 429 responses include wait time information
   - Old rate limiting entries are automatically cleaned up

## Verification Process

To verify that all fixes have been successfully implemented, we've created comprehensive verification scripts:

### 1. OpenAI Integration Verification

The `verify-openai-integration.ps1` script tests:
- Loading of the OpenAI API key from different sources
- Compatibility with both legacy and new OpenAI clients
- Making actual API calls to verify connectivity
- Application of the fix module during runtime

### 2. Rate Limiting Verification

The verification tests confirm:
- First request to profile endpoint succeeds (200 OK)
- Second immediate request is rate-limited (429 Too Many Requests)
- Response includes wait_time information
- Third request after waiting the specified time succeeds (200 OK)

### 3. Assessment History Verification

The verification process tests:
- Retrieving all assessments without errors
- Getting a specific assessment by ID
- Creating a new assessment
- Proper handling of different data formats

### 4. Comprehensive Verification

The `verify-all-fixes.ps1` script runs all verification tests and produces a detailed report with:
- Summary of test results
- Logs of all verification steps
- Overall pass/fail status for each component
